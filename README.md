# Pomodoro Timer ⏲️

This repository contains a simple **Pomodoro Timer** built with Python. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps individuals stay productive by breaking down their work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes of work followed by a short break. For now, this application is only available for macOS.

## Features

- **Work Timer**: Default 25-minute work sessions.
- **Break Timer**: Short 5-minute breaks between work sessions.
- **Rest Timer**: Long 20-minute break after four work sessions.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust the work and break intervals by modifying the script.
- **Visual Feedback**: Uses `tomato.png` to provide a fun, visual element for the timer.
- **Notifications**: Notifies everytime the timer goes off, whether break session or work.


### Files

- **`main.py`**: This is the core Python script that implements the timer logic. It allows you to run the timer with the standard Pomodoro intervals.
  
- **`tomato.png`**: This image file is used to represent the Pomodoro timer's visual element. Feel free to replace this image with any other that suits your preferences.
